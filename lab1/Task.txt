1. Persistent layer design

In this lab, you will make a flat star schema ER diagram for Data Warehouse. Use the flight delays dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv to make an initial analysis.

Details

Use a tool of your preference (draw.io is recommended) to make an ER diagram. Follow the next rules:

1. Use every column in the dataset

2. Diagram has to have no complex/custom data types

3. The final design has to follow star schema principles

Results
